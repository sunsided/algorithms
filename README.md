Algorithm library and testbed
=============================

This project implements (or will - over time - implement) various 
algorithms in C# in order to study and use them.

Currently, the library consists only of a handful of algorithms
and data structures.
 
### Algorithms
 
- Quickselect

### Data Structures

- Binary Tree
    - In-, Level-, Pre- and Post-Order Traversals
    - Recursive In-, Pre- and Post-Order Traversals
- Min Heap and Max Heap
